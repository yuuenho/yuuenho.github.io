      <div><b>The Problem</b>
        <p>While the Royal Ontario Museum's (ROM) annual attendance has increased over the last 10 years, numbers of
          kids who go each year has declined by half during that time.</p>
        <p>
          When talking to parents, distance and time were definitely factors for parents but for many of which they
          relied on their kids to let them know if going to the ROM it would be something they the kids wanted to do
          and
          would be excited for.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was especially problematic in cases where the kids weren’t even aware of what they would expect if they
          went
          to the ROM or how that experience would look like in comparison to things like the zoo which generally kids
          have
          a greater understanding and expectation of.</p>

      <div><b>The Scope</b>
        <p>
          For my final project with Bitmaker I wanted to to bridge that experience so that kids didn’t have to be at
          the
          ROM physically to be able to engage with ROM programming. ROM Kids was envisioned to provide kids with
          digital
          access to the ROM in a age-appropriate format through mobile app.</p>
        <p>
          ROM Kids is not a new idea, the ROM already runs programming under this name but the programming that they
          provide are limited to onsite activities and content.</p>
        <p>
          In deciding my audience, I selected and interviewed kids from age 6 - 8 and their parents. My audience
          primarily all lived in the GTA but not in within the city.</p>

        <p>
          Before conducting my one-on-one interviews, a lot of time was spent researching the nuances and understanding
          the landscape of designing for kids. Thankfully there’s no shortage of literature on the topic.<p> Click the

        When taking in all that information,
        it was important to note things like when designing for adults we often skip over reading comprehension and
        dexterity in our considerations,
        for kids, however, different ages will attribute greatly to the development of a child’s ability. As such the
        industry generally will design
        for distinct ages groups ranging 2 - 3 years per grouping between the ages of 0 - 12.

        Given the time frame I had with only 3 weeks, I opted not to build a platform that tried to hit every age group
        but focus in on a particular range. As my challenge was to create the experience of the ROM in a digital space,
        I wanted my target audience to be younger so that they would have limited prior experiences with other museums
        or the ROM specifically. I chose kids between 6 - 8 since they had more of an ability to orally communicate
        their likes and dislikes in a richer context. Sadly. this didn’t mean interviewing them was easier. Keeping
        kids focused while asking them questions like what they thought a museum was like was definitely a challenge.
        Many of which I lost, which meant lots of breaks. <p>
          With a lot of patience, what I found was:
          <br>Young kids had very little knowledge about what museum were about, Most could articulate dinosaurs but
          not much else.
          <br>Those that had been to the museum had a hard time remember what was there or what they saw.
          <br>The range of apps kids were interested in varied greatly in the app type and topic, but all centered
          around being “fun”. </p>

        When we design, we look at ideas of utility, functionality and enjoyment to gauge the success of our designs.
        Functionality is fairly simple, it has to work. While adults prioritize how useful a design can be, kids
        prioritize their enjoyment of their experience. A design has no merit for a kid if it is boring or unengaging
        where as an adult may suffer a unpleasant experience if it get the task that they need done accomplished.

        Parents said that they often didn’t have enough time to do everything that they wanted to do with their kids.
        As much as parents typically thought the ROM was a worthwhile outting for their family, it was not one many had
        done or prioritized relative to other city attractions. Often opting for other attractions that their kids
        asked to go to such as the zoo or aquarium.
        <p>Some parents with multiple children struggled with finding attractions that were engaging to all their kids
          as age differed.</p>

        In terms of their kids and technology, most parents were concerned with the degree in digital consumption their
        kids was participating in. However, they felt apps for educational purposes were significantly less of a
        concern for them when it came to how their kids spent their time.

        In terms of the museum itself, I looked into what the ROM had done in the past, again the ROM currently has a
        program on-site where kids can participate in activities and ROM content. Additionally the ROM had actually
        launched an app in 2012 called ScopifyROM which showed additional content while you explored the ROM. The
        challenge with both is that they rely on users to already be at the ROM and do not market to those who haven’t
        decided if they are interested in going.

        Understanding that for rich feedback from user testing among children, much of the visual content needed to be
        available early on. Blockframes and description of content were things that even from hallway testing with kids
        were not effective. All the design artifacts were rapidly produced but users were not part of the early
        processes. Much of the design choices for the interface were modelled off various games and apps that were
        currently popular for kids, this was something I chose not to focus too much time on in order to prioritize a
        working prototype.

        In the past I’ve worked with inVision and while it’s terrific for quick prototypes, the limitations of the
        transitions made it less appealing for this particular project. Flinto was a tool that had been brought to my
        attention a few times in the weeks leading up to this project, so I decided to take the bullet and dive into
        it. Flinto while still glitchy and temperamental combined prototyping with animation.

        In addition to the transitions, Flinto allowed for easier mapping of wireflows and error states for kids that
        didn’t feel disruptive. If kids tried accessing something they couldn’t instead of being taken to a screen that
        was not what they were expecting, they would simply be informed to select something else on the screen. This
        was done through looped wireflows where the transition triggers an audio prompt by a character guide.
