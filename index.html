        <div><b>The Problem</b>
          <p>While the Royal Ontario Museum's (ROM) annual attendance has increased over the last 10 years, numbers of
          kids who go each year has declined by half during that time.</p>
          <p>
            When talking to parents, distance and time were definitely factors for parents but for many of which they
            relied on their kids to let them know if going to the ROM it would be something they the kids wanted to do and
            would be excited for.
          </p><p>
          This was especially problematic in cases where the kids weren’t even aware of what they would expect if they went
          to the ROM or how that experience would look like in comparison to things like the zoo which generally kids have
          a greater understanding and expectation of.</p>

      <div><b>The Scope</b>
        <p>
          For my final project with Bitmaker I wanted to to bridge that experience so that kids didn’t have to be at the
          ROM physically to be able to engage with ROM programming. ROM Kids was envisioned to provide kids with digital
          access to the ROM in a age-appropriate format through mobile app.</p>
          <p>
            ROM Kids is not a new idea, the ROM already runs programming under this name but the programming that they
            provide are limited to onsite activities and content.</p>
            <p>
              In deciding my audience, I selected and interviewed kids from age 6 - 8 and their parents. My audience
              primarily all lived in the GTA but not in within the city.</p>

      <div><b>Discovery</b>
        <p>
          Before conducting my one-on-one interviews, a lot of time was spent researching the nuances and understanding
          the landscape of designing for kids. Thankfully there’s no shortage of literature on the topic.<p> Click the
            icons if you want to read more.</p>

        <div>
              When taking in all that information, 
              it was important to note things like when designing for adults we often skip over reading comprehension and dexterity in our considerations, 
              for kids, however, different ages will attribute greatly to the development of a child’s ability. As such the industry generally will design 
              for distinct ages groups ranging 2 - 3 years per grouping between the ages of 0 - 12.

            Though kids are becoming more and more technology savvy at an earlier age, their preference tends to be with tablets while as age increases the preference shifts to laptops or desktops.

      Given the time frame I had with only 3 weeks, I opted not to build a platform that tried to hit every age group but focus in on a particular range. As my challenge was to create the experience of the ROM in a digital space, I wanted my target audience to be younger so that they would have limited prior experiences with other museums or the ROM specifically. I chose kids between 6 - 8 since they had more of an ability to orally communicate their likes and dislikes in a richer context. Sadly. this didn’t mean interviewing them was easier. Keeping kids focused while asking them questions like what they thought a museum was like was definitely a challenge. Many of which I lost, which meant lots of breaks. <p>
      With a lot of patience, what I found was:
      <br>Young kids had very little knowledge about what museum were about, Most could articulate dinosaurs but not much else.
      <br>Those that had been to the museum had a hard time remember what was there or what they saw.
      <br>The range of apps kids were interested in varied greatly in the app type and topic, but all centered around being “fun”.  </p>

        <div>
    When we design, we look at ideas of utility, functionality and enjoyment to gauge the success of our designs. Functionality is fairly simple, it has to work. While adults prioritize how useful a design can be, kids prioritize their enjoyment of their experience. A design has no merit for a kid if it is boring or unengaging where as an adult may suffer a unpleasant experience if it get the task that they need done accomplished.
