            <p class="rk-text">While the ROM currently runs programming under the brand ROM Kids, it’s currently limited to on-site activities and content. For my final project at Bitmaker, I wanted to extend this experience so that kids could engage with ROM programming remotely. <br>‍<br>In 2012, the ROM launched an app called ScopifyROM, which presented users supplementary content while they explored the ROM. Like the current ROMKids programming, the app required users to be physically present in the ROM, which fails to attract new attendees who aren&#x27;t already committed to going to the ROM already.<br>‍<br>This project was not affiliated with the Royal Ontario Museum and spanned just over three weeks working alone to conduct research, ideate possible solutions, develop the UI, build the branding and create all visual artifacts. The result was an interactive age-appropriate high fidelity prototype with video content. </p>

            <p class="rk-text">This was my first time building something for kids so before I started conducting my one-on-one interviews, I spent some time researching the nuances in designing for kids. Thankfully there’s no shortage of literature on the topic. These are some of the resources I used before getting started.</p>

            <p class="rk-text">In determining my audience, I selected and interviewed kids between the age of 6 to 8 and their parents. My audience primarily lived in the GTA but outside the City of Toronto. I chose this specific age group since they had more of an ability to orally communicate their likes and dislikes in a richer context. I started my research with family members that had kids and had them introduce me to their friends with kids to build a bigger group to interview.</p>

            <h4 class="rksectionheading">Design</h4>
            <p class="rk-text">Referencing the research I looked in the differences between designing for kids and for adult audience, reading comprehension and dexterity are important factors when building an application for children. Typically, the educational software industry will segment the child market into distinct age brackets of 2-3 years in range to accommodate for rapid changes in mental and physical ability. This was also the reason I set my research age bracket to that 6 - 8 age range. These factors went into how I set out my initiate ideas and designs in terms of spacing, layout, interactions and content.<br>‍<br>Early stage designs such as sketches and paper prototypes made it difficult for user testing among kids. They struggled with conceptualizing and anticipating responses from the paper prototype when presented with block wireframes with textual or oral descriptions of what would happen. I ended up doing some simple mock drawings with toy representations of museum objects and guiding kids roughly through storytelling to lead them through each activity.</p>
            <div class="div-block-53"><img src="images/roomdrawing.JPG" srcset="images/roomdrawing-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/roomdrawing-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/roomdrawing-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/roomdrawing-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/roomdrawing.JPG 2140w" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="image-19"><img src="images/roomlofi.jpg" alt="" class="image-22"></div>
            <p class="rk-text">While having experienced success with InVision in the past, the limited transition animations made it less appealing for a hi-fidelity prototype in this particular project. I decided to experiment with an alternative tool, Flinto which provided enhanced transitions and allowed for easier mapping of  flows and error states. This solution proved to be less distracting for the test group. While those were all great reasons to use Flinto the biggest benefit from using Flinto was that it allowed for audio feedback which was really important for users that needed more guidance throughout the app and those with low reading comprehension.</p>

            <p class="rk-text">One thing that really stood out for me for this project was that as I did more research and went back to validate my ideas, the more I found that I was not creating just a digital project but creating a brand for individuals to connect with the Royal Ontario Museum especially for a younger audience.<br>‍<br>One thing that I initially missed was defining my KPI for parents. While I had set my focus on kids for measuring my success. Overall even if kids enjoyed the app, parents were the ones who eventually would decide whether or not they would visit the museum. While I included elements around education which were what parents were concerned about, in my testing I didn&#x27;t go back to test and validate if the app would be something the parents would approve of and met their needs. With this in mind, it&#x27;s important for me to recognize that when considering users, I needs to consider all users - even the indirect ones.</p>

A challenge that arose in the research was that while most users agreed temperament was important to consider, there was no clear definition between users of what that meant. Some attributed temperament as a behaviour while others defined it as moods. Doing some addition online research into canine psychology still left me with a lot of questions<br>‍<br>Rather than having temperament described in one dimension, I took the most common behaviours which users identified as important for them and allowed users to select on a spectrum the closest to what they believe described their dog. This seems appropriate for users as going into moods may be good for owners when understanding their own dogs but wasn&#x27;t too helpful when looking at socializing dogs with other dogs.</div><img src="images/slider-min.gif" id="w-node-5e0277facb24-adc1772a" alt="" class="image-9">

With conventional dating apps, users typically only need to two make a profile for themselves and highlight what they&#x27;re looking for in a match. <br>‍<br>Users builds three profiles: the user’s, their dog, and the prospective matching dog. The initial on-boarding focuses on the user and their dog. Additional prompts are spaced out throughout use of the app to continue building the profile. Giving users more control in this process, they are able to skip and complete these parts later. </div>

This project was an exciting way for me to be introduced to animation and motion.<br><br>The biggest insight I could take from this project is that while the needs and concerns of users can often be the same, users can perceive and approach that problem-space in radically different ways. In recognizing something like temperament as a complex idea, it allows me to think of my users in a richer context and design more appropriately.</div>

          <p class="paragraph">Born and raised in Toronto - my style has always mirrored the city&#x27;s vibrancy and quirkiness. Growing up in Toronto and starting my career in accessibility working with students with disabilities. I&#x27;ve spent my journey trying to make the world better for others and in doing so trying to understand their experiences. From that, I&#x27;ve learned that each experience - whether from culture or disability - can contribute to any endeavour as a perspective of diversity and makes whatever you produce that much richer when included.<br><br>When I&#x27;m not designing webpages and crafting thoughtful user experiences, I&#x27;m designing costumes. I really enjoy exploring different ways to make costumes using things like LEDs and Arduino boards.
