          <div><strong class="rk-cs-text">This project was to bridge the experience so that kids didn’t have to be at the ROM physically to be able to engage with ROM programming. ROM Kids was envisioned to provide kids with digital access to the ROM in a age-appropriate format through mobile app.</strong></div>
          <div class="rk-cs-text"><strong class="rk-cs-text">Being a part of a big family means lots of kids, what&#x27;s surprising is that while figuring out a weekend activity with my nieces and nephew that most of them haven&#x27;t been to the Royal Ontario Museum, let alone was aware of what they could see or do there. While the Royal Ontario Museum&#x27;s (ROM) annual attendance has increased over the last 10 years, numbers of kids who go each year has declined by half during that time.</strong><br><strong class="rk-cs-text">When talking to parents, distance and time were definitely factors for parents but for many of which they relied on their kids to let them know if going to the ROM it would be something they the kids wanted to do and would be excited for. </strong><br><strong class="rk-cs-text">This was especially problematic in cases where the kids weren’t even aware of what they would expect if they went to the ROM or how that experience would look like in comparison to things like the zoo which generally kids have a greater understanding and expectation of.</strong></div>

            <div>Initial Insights<br>- For kids, different ages will attribute greatly to the development of a child&#x27;s ability (ie. reading comprehension or dexterity<br>- Younger kids prefer tablets while as age increases the preference shifts to laptops and desktops</div>
          </div>
          <div><strong class="rk-cs-text">Given the time frame I had with only 3 weeks, I opted not to build a platform that tried to hit every age group but focus in on a particular range. As my challenge was to create the experience of the ROM in a digital space, I wanted my target audience to be younger so that they would have limited prior experiences with other museums or the ROM specifically. I chose kids between 6 - 8 since they had more of an ability to orally communicate their likes and dislikes in a richer context.</strong></div>
          <div><strong class="rk-cs-text">Parents said that they often didn’t have enough time to do everything that they wanted to do with their kids. As much as parents typically thought the ROM was a worthwhile outting for their family, it was not one many had done or prioritized relative to other city attractions. Often opting for other attractions that their kids asked to go to such as the zoo or aquarium.</strong><br><strong class="rk-cs-text">Some parents with multiple children struggled with finding attractions that were engaging to all their kids as age differed.</strong><br><strong>In terms of their kids and technology, most parents were concerned with the degree in digital consumption their kids was participating in. However, they felt apps for educational purposes were significantly less of a concern for them when it came to how their kids spent their time.</strong></div>
          <div><strong>The ROM had actually launched an app in 2012 called ScopifyROM which showed additional content while you explored the ROM. The challenge with both is that they rely on users to already be at the ROM and do not market to those who haven’t decided if they are interested in going.</strong></div>
          <div class="rk-cs-text"><strong class="rk-cs-text">Understanding that for rich feedback from user testing among children, much of the visual content needed to be available early on. Block wireframes and description of content were things that even from hallway testing with kids were not effective. All the design artifacts were rapidly produced but users were not part of the early processes. Much of the design choices for the interface were modelled off various games and apps that were currently popular for kids, this was something I chose not to focus too much time on in order to prioritize a working prototype.</strong><br><br><strong class="rk-cs-text"> In the past I’ve worked with Invision and while it’s terrific for quick prototypes, the limitations of the transitions made it less appealing for this particular project. Flinto was a tool that had been brought to my attention a few times in the weeks leading up to this project, so I decided to take the bullet and dive into it. Flinto while still glitchy and temperamental combined prototyping with animation. </strong><br><strong class="rk-cs-text">In addition to the transitions, Flinto allowed for easier mapping of wireflows and error states for kids that didn’t feel disruptive. If kids tried accessing something they couldn’t instead of being taken to a screen that was not what they were expecting, they would simply be informed to select something else on the screen. This was done through looped wireflows where the transition triggers an audio prompt by a character guide.</strong></div>
          <div>A character guide joins users to help them navigate through the different activities. They act as a familiar face and allows for non-intrusive prompts or reminders. They also allow for any of the on-boarding portions as a conversation between the character and the user rather than filling in forms.<br><br><br>The app is narrated (often by the character guide) this allows for kids to have enjoyable experience even if their reading comprehension is at a lower level. The narration also also for kids who struggle with dyslexia to have an alternative medium for the content and the prompts and reminders help for kids who struggle with focusing. Narration of this app is brought courtesy of some friends of mine :)</div>

          <div class="rk-cs-text"><strong class="rk-cs-text">A part in which was a big struggle for me was definitely keeping this in the scope of a UX project specifically as the project was really quite big. My initial plan was actually to build a visual design language that would be able to be applied for different institutions rather than focus on one specifically and their content. While the three weeks was not a long enough of a time frame for that. It is something that played into many of my decisions and hopefully something that would still apply to the changes of other institutions who are in similar situations to the ROM like the Art Gallery of Ontario.</strong><br><strong class="rk-cs-text">Largely my two measures of success and performance were basically if kids would want to continue playing with the app and if this would lead to them asking their parents to go to the ROM. I think a part that I would have liked to break down more is whether or not elements of the platform and the interactions were the reasons for those success or if it was just the content. I think most of this relied on needing more time to develop stronger theories and then user testing to gather findings.</strong></div>
          <div><strong class="rk-cs-text">As this project was spanned only across 3 weeks, a lots of things were rushed through to ensure the prototype was ready. Continuing to develop the app, I would love to revisit and explore different things such as the copy and the audio from the app, to make it more age-appropriate and inviting. Additionally I would love to see how different activities could be used in the app as well that engages and educates as well. </strong><br><strong class="rk-cs-text">‍</strong></div>
          <div>

This would need to be revisited should those elements be introduced especially in the case of a premium models.<br>While this project is not made with the intent to launch, things I would love to explore and potentially how this could be bridge with the ROM - this would include things as AR exhibits in their Samuel European Galleries which showcase history rooms and decor. This would be an excellent opportunity to show what life would be like in that era in the context of those rooms.<br>Other things that took a back seat because of time was the development for access between iPad and iPhone devices. It was initially designed for iPad but important to note that it’s easier for kids to hold and explore the ROM with an iPhone for future features like AR.<br><br><br>ROM Kids is a brand and this app was intended as a a product under the brand. </div>

A challenge that arose in the research was that while most users agreed temperament was important to consider, there was no clear definition between users of what that meant. Some attributed temperament as a behaviour while others defined it as moods. Doing some addition online research into canine psychology still left me with a lot of questions<br>‍<br>Rather than having temperament described in one dimension, I took the most common behaviours which users identified as important for them and allowed users to select on a spectrum the closest to what they believe described their dog. This seems appropriate for users as going into moods may be good for owners when understanding their own dogs but wasn&#x27;t too helpful when looking at socializing dogs with other dogs.</div><img src="images/slider-min.gif" id="w-node-5e0277facb24-adc1772a" alt="" class="image-9">

With conventional dating apps, users typically only need to two make a profile for themselves and highlight what they&#x27;re looking for in a match. <br>‍<br>Users builds three profiles: the user’s, their dog, and the prospective matching dog. The initial on-boarding focuses on the user and their dog. Additional prompts are spaced out throughout use of the app to continue building the profile. Giving users more control in this process, they are able to skip and complete these parts later. </div>

In recognizing something like temperament as a complex idea, it allows me to think of my users in a richer context and design more appropriately.</div>

          <p class="paragraph">Born and raised in Toronto - my style has always mirrored the city&#x27;s vibrancy and quirkiness. Growing up in Toronto and starting my career in accessibility working with students with disabilities. I&#x27;ve spent my journey trying to make the world better for others and in doing so trying to understand their experiences. From that, I&#x27;ve learned that each experience - whether from culture or disability - can contribute to any endeavour as a perspective of diversity and makes whatever you produce that much richer when included.<br><br>When I&#x27;m not designing webpages and crafting thoughtful user experiences, I&#x27;m designing costumes. I really enjoy exploring different ways to make costumes using things like LEDs and Arduino boards.
